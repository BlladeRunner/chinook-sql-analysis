# ðŸŽµ Chinook Music Store Analytics (SQLite + SQL)

## Overview

SQL portfolio project on the classic **Chinook** dataset (albums, tracks, customers, invoices).  
Questions answered: monthly revenue, top customers, countries/genres performance, employee sales, market basket (track pairs), cohorts, and RFM segmentation.

# 2) Build helper view
sqlite3 chinook.db ".read bootstrap_chinook.sql"

# 3) Run analysis queries (VS Code + SQLTools)
# open queries.sql â†’ select query â†’ Ctrl+E, Ctrl+E
```
